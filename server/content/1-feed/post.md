I went to a [meetup](http://meetup.com) yesterday, and it was a lot of fun. I saw all kinds of people like:

* developers
* entrepreneurs
* designers

You should try it out too!

comments[]: I'm totally going there, too!

comments[]: Not if I get there first!
-----
comments[]: Developers > everyone else.
-----
comments[]: Angular is awesome!
-----
comments[]: I don't see how that's relevant.
